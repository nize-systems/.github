# Nize Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Nize, we take all security bugs related to our code and our infrastructure very seriously. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report any security bugs to the *Department of Security* (Vishal Muthuraja, Prem Giridhar, Logan Dickey).

The Department of Security will acknowledge your report within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response very soon indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance. We expect you to maintain full confidentiality during this process.

The following are out of scope and should not be attacked/performed:
- Excessive Automated Scans
- Denial of Service Attacks
- Social Engineering Attacks
- Reports against infrastructure outside our control
- User or admin accounts not owned by the tester

## Disclousure Policy

When we receive a security report, that report will be reviewed by members of the Department of Security. That person will coordinate the fix, release, and announcement process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected services.
2. Audit infrastructure and/or code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Prepare fixes for all releases currently in production, which will be implemented as quickly as possible.
If user data was directly affected or compromised, we will inform affected users about the incident to the best of our ability.
