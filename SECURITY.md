# Nize Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Nize, we take all security bugs related to our code and our infrastructure very seriously. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report any security flaws to the **Department of Security** (Vishal Muthuraja, Prem Giridhar, Logan Dickey). DO NOT create an issue in the affected repository to report security vulnerabilities.

The Department of Security will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will send a more detailed response shortly to indicate the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply, the security team will continue to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement and may ask for additional information or guidance. We expect you to maintain full confidentiality during this process.

The following are out of scope and should not be attacked/performed:
- Excessive automated scans
- Denial of Service attacks
- Social Engineering Attacks
- Reports against infrastructure outside our control
- User or admin accounts not owned by the tester

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security report, that report will be reviewed by members of the Department of Security. That person will coordinate the fix, release, and announcement of the reported issues in the following manner:

1. Confirming the problem and determining affected services.
2. Auditing the infrastructure and/or code to find any potential similar problems.
3. Preparing and implementing fixes for all releases currently in production as quickly as possible.

If user data is compromised or otherwise directly affected, we will inform affected users about the incident to the best of our ability.
